# Notes/Things to do

[ ] Create getPossibleMoves() function - When piece is clicked, returns all valid moves
[ ] Allow pieces to move and swap turns
[ ] Add checking for checks 
[ ] Potentially update PieceT to include hasMoved ( mainly for pawns and castling )
[ ] Refactor???? Memoize the board so only changed cells get re-rendered
